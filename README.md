# Excercises Solutions

Intended to store my **solutions to the excercises** proposed in different  
**problem-solving platforms** such as [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)  and [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com) so that I'll  
be able to review the code. Maybe it _could_ also be helpful for others.  

> **Note:** The solutions are written in **Python 3.11** and for now the code  
> won't have further explanation until I'm natural with _Big O Notation_  
> and other concepts.

**TODO**: Make a README for each excercise and add the link to the problem.
